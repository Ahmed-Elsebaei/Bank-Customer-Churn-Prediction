# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
- In this project, I trained 3 models and cross-validated their best parameters to predict the customers who will churn.
- Used MinMax Scaler to scale my features.
- Used RandomizedSearchCV to tune the hyperparameters. 
- Obtained a SVM model with 86% accuracy & 84.27% Precision.
- Applied EDA using Microsoft Power BI on this link https://www.novypro.com/project/customer-churn--1
